# Readme

This project is the backend part of EAM system (course work of Software Engineering). The backend uses the Django framework and the frontend uses the React framework and Antd component library.

The main goal of this project is to develop an enterprise fixed asset management system that can easily perform a series of operations such as entry, modification, transfer, and withdrawal of fixed assets, and can clearly display the entire life cycle of fixed assets for easy management and viewing. At the same time, administrators can also track the asset changes of a specific asset or a department's assets through historical and statistical functions, so as to quickly discover and trace the source when fixed assets have problems, and improve the efficiency of problem solving.

From the user's perspective, this system can mainly provide a more efficient and convenient asset management method for two roles in the enterprise: administrators and users.

In this system, administrators should be able to quickly enter, modify, and withdraw assets, and can grasp the status of fixed assets from a macro perspective through statistics, history and other information to eliminate possible related problems.
Users can use system functions to apply for property claims, maintenance and other requests, and divide the complicated work of fixed asset management into smaller, easier-to-manage fragments and distribute them to more users, thereby improving management efficiency and quality.
